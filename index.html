	<p style="text-align: center">My name is Sean Coakley. I am from Chattanooga, TN. I went to Gordon Lee High School where I played football and baseball. I played baseball at Cleveland State Community College before transferring to UGA this fall. I am a sports management major.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">My parents are Wendie and Tim Coakley. I have one older brother named Connor. My family loves vacationing at the beach, as well as ski trips to Colorado. I have a dog named Buddy who is 13 years old. My family is Florida State Seminole fans, but I have converted to a Dawg!</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">Sports have been a huge part of my life up to this point. I played baseball practically all my life. I played in Cooperstown, NY twice in the youth national championships. I played in college for two years before having my career cut short by an injury. Baseball taught my so many lessons about leadership and life. I will continue to use these lessons throughout my school and career.</p>
